# UMN-VR Quest 2 Photogrammetry Demo

An Open Source demonstration of photogrammetry in VR, made in Unity for Quest 2 & WebVR

Try the WebXR Build on a SteamVR headset!
[https://UMN-VR.github.io/WebGL_Demo](https://umn-vr.github.io/WebGL_Demo/)
(technically runs on a quest 2 as well, but not optimized & has significant performance issues due to wasteful software stack and completely unoptimized scene. )

## Overview
The aim of this project is to create a virtual museum inspired on a real life one. Using the same artifacts but on you and improved virtual environment. This will give the U a global reach and cement the university's position as a pioneer in virtual reality. 

#### Hardware:
At the present moment only Quest 2 native SDK & WebXR app builds are being provided since the project is just at the proof of concept stage. Eventually the idea is to release a WebXR build using Babylon.js not WebGL and host it on a domain so that everyone can access it regardless of platform. 


#### Software:
The proof of concept project was created using Unity and it is likely that the same workflows and platforms will be used to make the final product, we will just be tweaking the specifics of it to improve the final result.

To open up the project all you need to do is have a current installation of:

* Unity v2021.1.3.1f1

If you want to edit 3d Models:

* Blender (Any version will work really, would recomend using latest avaliable.)

If you want to scan your own 3d Models 

* Polycam (IOs App works better, would recomend using latest avaliable.)

##### Software Checkout and Setup:

You should create a copy of this repository structured as follows

## Description of App Versioning 


##### v1.0: 
Avaliable only for QuestSDK.
App does not include any multiplayer or in game interactivity functionality is simply starts up the scene starts rendering the scene and never changes it.
###### ⚠️This version includes the following 32-bit only (armeabi-v7a) libraries: libMonoPosixHelper.so, libOVRPlugin.so, libOculusXRPlugin.so, libmain.so, libmemalign16.so, libmemalign16_cpp.so, libmono-native.so, libmonobdwgc-2.0.so, libopenxr_loader.so, libunity.so


##### v1.1: 
Avaliable only for QuestSDK.
App does not include any multiplayer or in game interactivity functionality is simply starts up the scene starts rendering the scene and never changes it. Replaced 32-bit libs with 64-bit for App Lab Submission.




##### v2.0: 
Avaliable only for webXR.
App does not include any multiplayer, but allows for in-game interactivity with cubes and a sphere. Themed Mozilla's 3D desert env to replace plane.


## Additional Project Components & Tecniques 

#### WebXR 
This is the software that allows for a unity environment to be packaged as a website plug-in that allows for a VR experience without installation of an application. 

#### ShapesXR Plugin:
Allows for direct import of models created in shapesXR. After the models have been imported it is recommended to uninstall and remove the file located in assets since failing to doing so usually means you won't be able to build successfully. 

#### Lowering polygon counts:
If performance is lackluster polygon counts can be reduced through joining close together nodes to create a mesh with a smaller filesize. You can also trim unnecessary parts of the model that take up space and don't contribute to aesthetics. This is all done in blender. 

#### WebGL:
Web GL is the render engine that allows WebXR to function. It is part of this software stack that will power the in-browser VR experience. 



## Future Work
Actually scan museum artifacts.
